                <aside class="notes">
                    Voglio cominciare iniziando a spiegarvi il perchè di questa presentazione.
                    Lo scopo di questa presentazione è per lo più quello di far riflettere sulla scrittura di codice e
                    quali aspetti del nostro lavoro sono i più importanti e magari spronare sopratutto quelli che hanno
                    iniziato da poco
                    a riflettere su alcuni aspetti del mondo della programmazione.
                    Io stesso mi ritenevo un buon programmatore dato che il mio codice funzionava ma poi in realtà una
                    volta partecipato a conferenze come phpday e simili ti rendi conto di non sapere un cazzo e capisci
                    che è importante
                    studiare e riuscire a "livellare" migliorando costantemente nel tempo.
                    Fatevi una domanda..

                Le attività che fanno parte della costruzione di un software sono tantissime.
                Oggi ci concentreremo principalmente sulla parte relativa ai requisiti e sulla parte di "Construction"
                in cui si va effettivamente a scrivere codice
                Ognuna di queste fasi è però importante e sarebbe bello se in futuro qualcuno si proponesse per fare
                talk anche su altri aspetti.
                Code Complete si sofferma su ognuna di queste fasi e fa rimandi ad altri libri/fonti per cui lo
                consiglio come punto di partenza per chi voglia iniziare a studiarsi meglio i vari aspetti.

                        Part of your job as a technical employee is to educate the nontechnical people around
                        you about the development process. This section will help you deal with managers
                        and bosses who have not yet seen the light. It’s an extended argument for doing
                        requirements and architecture—getting the critical aspects right—before you begin cod-
                        ing, testing, and debugging. Learn the argument, and then sit down with your boss
                        and have a heart-to-heart talk about the programming process.

                        One of the key ideas in effective programming is that preparation is important. It
                        makes sense that before you start working on a big project, you should plan the
                        project. Big projects require more planning; small projects require less. From a man-
                        agement point of view, planning means determining the amount of time, number of
                        people, and number of computers the project will need. From a technical point of
                        view, planning means understanding what you want to build so that you don’t waste
                        money building the wrong thing. Sometimes users aren’t entirely sure what they want
                        at first, so it might take more effort than seems ideal to find out what they really want.
                        But that’s cheaper than building the wrong thing, throwing it away, and starting over.
                        It’s also important to think about how to build the system before you begin to build it.
                        You don’t want to spend a lot of time and money going down blind alleys when
                        there’s no need to, especially when that increases costs.

                <h2>E' fondamentale enfatizzare la qualità fin dall'inizio del progetto, anche imparare a prendere
                    requisiti deve essere una skill che va raggiunta</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    If you emphasize quality at the beginning of the project, you plan for, require, and
                    design a high-quality product. If you start the process with designs for a Pontiac Aztek,
                    you can test it all you want to, and it will never turn into a Rolls-Royce. You might
                    build the best possible Aztek, but if you want a Rolls-Royce, you have to plan from the
                    beginning to build one. In software development, you do such planning when you
                    define the problem, when you specify the solution, and when you design the solution.
                    Since construction is in the middle of a software project, by the time you get to con-
                    struction, the earlier parts of the project have already laid some of the groundwork for
                    success or failure. During construction, however, you should at least be able to deter-
                    mine how good your situation is and to back up if you see the black clouds of failure
                    looming on the horizon. The rest of this chapter describes in detail why proper prep-
                    aration is important and tells you how to determine whether you’re really ready to
                    begin construction.

                <p>A problem definition defines what the problem is without any reference to possible
                    solutions. It’s a simple statement, maybe one or two pages, and it should sound like a
                    problem. The statement “We can’t keep up with orders for the Gigatron” sounds like
                    a problem and is a good problem definition. The statement “We need to optimize our
                    automated data-entry system to keep up with orders for the Gigatron” is a poor prob-
                    lem definition. It doesn’t sound like a problem; it sounds like a solution.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    The problem definition should be in user language, and the problem should be
                    described from a user’s point of view. It usually should not be stated in technical com-
                    puter terms.

                <h2>Redazione di una lista di requisiti/specifiche del progetto</h2>
                <p>
                    Requirements describe in detail what a software system is supposed to do, and they
                    are the first step toward a solution.

            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Paying attention to requirements helps to minimize changes to a system after develop-
                    ment begins. If you find a coding error during coding, you change a few lines of code
                    and work goes on. If you find a requirements error during coding, you have to alter
                    the design to meet the changed requirement. You might have to throw away part of the
                    old design, and because it has to accommodate code that’s already written, the new
                    design will take longer than it would have in the first place.</p>

                    ture varies according to the needs of your project. Generally, a well-run project devotes
                    about 10 to 20 percent of its effort and about 20 to 30 percent of its schedule to require-
                    ments, architecture, and up-front planning (McConnell 1998, Kruchten 2000)</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <p>
                    The overarching goal of preparing for construction is risk reduction. Be sure
                    your preparation activities are reducing risks, not increasing them.
                    ■ If you want to develop high-quality software, attention to quality must be part of
                    the software-development process from the beginning to the end. Attention to
                    quality at the beginning has a greater influence on product quality than atten-
                    tion at the end.
                    ■ Part of a programmer’s job is to educate bosses and coworkers about the soft-
                    ware-development process, including the importance of adequate preparation
                    before programming begins.
                    ■ The kind of project you’re working on significantly affects construction prereq-
                    uisites—many projects should be highly iterative, and some should be more
                    sequential.
                    ■ If a good problem definition hasn’t been specified, you might be solving the
                    wrong problem during construction.
                    If good requirements work hasn’t been done, you might have missed important
                    details of the problem. Requirements changes cost 20 to 100 times as much in
                    the stages following construction as they do earlier, so be sure the requirements
                    are right before you start programming.
                    ■ If a good architectural design hasn’t been done, you might be solving the right
                    problem the wrong way during construction. The cost of architectural changes
                    increases as more code is written for the wrong architecture, so be sure the archi-
                    tecture is right, too.
                    ■ Understand what approach has been taken to the construction prerequisites on
                    your project, and choose your construction approach accordingly.

                <h4>
                    In a way, try blocks are like transactions. Your catch has to leave your program in a
                    consistent state, no matter what happens in the try . For this reason it is good practice to
                    start with a try - catch - finally statement when you are writing code that could throw
                    exceptions. This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what
                    goes wrong with the code that is executed in the try .
